    <h1>Migrate to api.adoptium.net</h1>
    <a href="https://blog.adoptopenjdk.net/2021/03/transition-to-eclipse-an-update/">AdoptOpenJDK has moved to the Eclipse Foundation</a>.

    <p>Adoptium is the successor project to AdoptOpenJDK. As part of the move, AdoptOpenJDK will no longer produce new builds.
        It is therefore recommended that:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Clients that require OpenJDK binaries should migrate to <a href="https://api.adoptium.net">api.adoptium.net</a> as soon as possible.</li>
        <li>Clients that require OpenJ9/Semeru builds for now can continue to use AdoptOpenJDK. However, you should look out for the upcoming Semeru api that
            will be the future delivery channel for Semeru builds.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Terms</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>AdoptOpenJDK - The legacy project</li>
        <li>api.adoptopenjdk.net - Legacy API of the AdoptOpenJDK project</li>
        <li>Adoptium - New Eclipse Project</li>
        <li>api.adoptium.net - New API for the Eclipse Adoptium project</li>
        <li>Temurin - The (TCK'd and AQA tested) OpenJDK binary produced by the Eclipse Adoptium project. Temurin binaries are the successor to AdoptOpenJDK binaries</li>
        <li>Semeru Open Edition - The name of the new distribution of the OpenJ9 project (not to confuse with Semeru Certified Edition, which is not related to AdoptOpenJDK)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>API compatibility</h3>
    <p>We have kept the API usage identical between the AdoptOpenJDK V3 API and api.adoptium.net for ease of migration.
        We plan to continue to maintain it as backwards compatible with the AdoptOpenJDK API.</p>

    <div style="background-color: lightgray; padding: 10px">
        <p>
            tl;dr :
        <ul>
            <li>The AdoptOpenJDK API will deliver legacy AdoptOpenJDK binaries, and for a limited transition period, also deliver Eclipse Temurin binaries</li>
            <li>The Eclipse Adoptium API will <strong>ONLY</strong> deliver Eclipse Adoptium binaries</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Updates To Vendor List</h3>

    <h4>Changes at AdoptOpenJDK</h4>

    <p>The Vendor list in the AdoptOpenJDK API (at time of writing) is as follows:</p>

    <code>adoptopenjdk, openjdk, alibaba, ibm, eclipse</code>

    <p>In the past we distributed both Hotspot and OpenJ9 under the <code>adoptopenjdk</code> Vendor.
        When requests were made that did not explicitly state which Vendor was required,
        the Vendor would default to <code>adoptopenjdk</code>.
    </p>

    <p>Now that AdoptOpenJDK will no-longer produce binaries, in order to keep delivering
        updates to those depending on the AdoptOpenJDK API, the Vendor <code>adoptopenjdk</code> has been
        made synonymous to <code>eclipse</code>. Requests that explicitly
        ask for <code>adoptopenjdk</code>, or do not specify a specific Vendor, will return
        assets that are produced by either <code>adoptopenjdk</code> (legacy) or <code>eclipse</code>. That
        synonym only works one way, requests asking specifically for <code>eclipse</code> will ONLY
        return builds produced by Eclipse Adoptium and NOT builds that were created at AdoptOpenJDK.</p>

    <p>The addition of the <code>ibm</code> vendor is to support the new Semeru project who will
        be distributing OpenJ9 builds.</p>

    <p>With the exception of legacy binaries, most requests for Hotspot JVMs should
        ultimately return an Eclipse Temurin binary.</p>

    <h4>Changes at Eclipse Adoptium</h4>
    <p><code>eclipse</code> has become the new default (and currently only) Vendor at api.adoptium.net. New releases will
        have the vendor <code>eclipse</code>. api.adoptium.net will only distribute binaries produced
        by Eclipse.
    </p>


    <h3>Updates To jvm_impl List</h3>

    <p>The jvm_impl list in the AdoptOpenJDK API is as follows:</p>
    <code>hotspot, openj9, dragonwell</code>

    <p>At api.adoptium.net (at time of writing), we are only distributing <code>hotspot</code> binaries,
        this has therefore become the one and only <code>jvm_impl</code> at api.adoptium.net</p>

    <h3>Reset stats</h3>

    <p>Download statistics at Adoptium will only show downloads of Temurin binaries.</p>
    <p>The AdoptOpenJDK API will only show download statistics of the legacy AdoptOpenJDK binaries.</p>
